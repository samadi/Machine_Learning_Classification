Here, we want to implement machine learning method in wine industry. The Wine Quality dataset, downloaded from Kaggle websit , is our dataset for this section. This dataset has1,599 instances of wine and 12 different variables. These variables are fixed acidity, citrus acid, volatile acidity, residual sugar, chlorides, thickness, free sulphur dioxide, absolute sulphur dioxide, pH, alcohol and sulphates. After selecting dataset, we will do some meticulous data preparation such as dealing with outliers and handling missing values are crucial steps to ensure about the reliability of our analysis. After this groundwork, we focus on two classification models: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree. These models are powerful tools for understanding and predicting wine quality. KNN method assume that similar wines share similar quality attributes while decision tree on the other hand, create a map of decisions based on the wine's features. 
On this research, our main goal is not only analysing wine quality but also understanding of how different classification models work in a dataset and what is the difference between them. At the end we compare the performance of KNN and decision trees to know which metho is better for our dataset.
